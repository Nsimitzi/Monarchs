This project was made possible by the Project Monarch Health(http://monarchparasites.uga.edu) at the University of Georgia. They granted me access to their data(2011-2015). Along with Dr. Patrick(Baylor University), I constructed a script to plot each monarch caught in the U.S via zipcode shape files and indicate their degree of infection by the parasite Ophryocystis elektroscirrha. The degree of infection was visualized using a color scale: Gray(0% infection) to red(100% infection).

Shapefiles are available at: https://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/cbf/cbf_zcta.html

Plot.R must be run with shapefiles and the .cvs files found in /Data.

Resulting plots for each year(2011-2015) found in /Plots
